The 1337 project "Born2beroot" is designed to provide hands-on experience with system administration basics. It guides us through the process of setting up and configuring a virtual machine, offering insights into essential concepts such as virtualization, partitioning schemes, LVM (Logical Volume Management), and command-line utilities. Key learning objectives include mastering protocols like SSH, understanding the importance of system security through sudo, firewalls, and password policies, and building a foundational understanding of how to protect and manage a secure system.
